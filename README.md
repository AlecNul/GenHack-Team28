## Setup

1. Create a venv and pip install -r requirements.txt so there's no pip install in the ipynb
2. If you need new libraries, after you pip install, pip freeze > requirements.txt so we also can dl it
3. For the data downloading, it's in the notebook, if it doesn't work, download it manually and put the data folder inside the GenHack-Team28 folder
